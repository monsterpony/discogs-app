# Discog App

Description: This app allows guests and users to search the Discogs api based on an Artist or Title. If you create an account, you can add/remove favorites to you collection and access a more comprehensive search feature.

## User Stories

* As a guest, I can search the database, to find a specific title/artist.
* As a guest, I can create an account, so I can save information about albums in my account
* As a user, I can search the database, to find a specific title/artist, and additional information that I cannot access in a guest search
* As a user, I can login to my account, to access stored data
* As a user, I can add add an item to my collection
* As a user, I can delete an item from my collection
* As a user, I can view my collection

*I would love for this app is to search the api and return the current price reflected for the chosen album (for both guests and users) - but in reading the documenation this requires the user to have their own Discogs account (not required to use my app) and an OAUTH private key.*
