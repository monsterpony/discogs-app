# Discog App



## User Stories

#### Guest

* As a guest, I can search the database, to find a specific album/title/artist.
* As a guest, I can create an account, so I can save information about albums in my account
#### User
* As a user, I can search the database, to find a specific album/title/artist
* As a user, I can login to my account, to access stored data

##### Ideas for App Functionality
* As a user, I can add an album as a favorite
* As a user, I can view my collection of favorites
* As a user, I can delete a favorite from my favorites
* As a user, I can add add an item to my collection
* As a user, I can delete an item from my collection
* As a user, I can view my collection

*I would love for this app is to search the database and return the current price reflected for the chosen album (for both guests and users) - but in reading the documenation I'm not sure this is possible without linking to an actual discogs account. If I cannot show the price, I will focus on one of the options above*


##FLOW

* Home/Landing (menu login)...search form on landing page, or button option
* Display for search results
* Login Screen
* Login Home Page that reflects user's name and links to their collection/favorites
* Collection/Favorites list view
* Collection/Favorites delete/remove...can it be done from list view or click-in to individual album and the option is found there (probably not worth it unless we can show album art)


**Favorite/Add to collection show only for logged in users or does it show and if clicked and user is not logged in the guest/user is promted to create an account or sign in to add to collection/favorite?

### Rough Wireframe as unsure if I can get images/price
